                    The SIGNAL resource was developed in a collaboration between the Berger and Taylor labs
                    along with key institutional partners at Memorial Sloan Kettering with the goal of establishing
                    a resource of integrated germline and somatic alterations identified by clinical sequencing of
                    active cancer patients. Provided here are pathogenic germline variants and their tumor-specific
                    zygosity changes by gene, lineage, and cancer type in 17,152 prospectively sequenced cancer patients.
                    All analyses are described in:
